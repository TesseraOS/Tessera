## 2026-06-28 — F-003 DONE: storage ports + 3 adapters + conformance
**What changed (inc 4 + close)**
- SQLite `RelationalStore` adapter: **better-sqlite3** (^12, prebuilt — no native compile) +
  **Drizzle** (^0.45); lifecycle (migrate/healthcheck/close) + typed `db` handle; relational
  conformance suite + a Drizzle round-trip integration test.
- `@tessera/storage` now: **3 ports + 3 local adapters** (sqlite, filesystem, in-process queue),
  each validated by a shared conformance suite. Effect **E-007** (storage port ⇒ adapters + suites).

**Evidence/verification (fresh, cache off):** typecheck · lint · format · build green;
test = core 15 + storage 13 = **28**. verify-state valid.

**Decisions:** SQLite driver = **better-sqlite3** (delegated to Claude; mature, Drizzle-proven,
prebuilt binary so no Windows compile). node:sqlite was the fallback — not needed.

**Next step:** **F-004** — VectorStore port + sqlite-vec adapter (semantic retrieval).

---

## 2026-06-28 — F-003 inc 3: filesystem BlobStore + turbo cache fix
**What changed**
- Filesystem `BlobStore` adapter (`node:fs`, traversal-safe keys) + blob conformance suite
  (`tests/conformance/blob.conformance.ts`) + integration test (temp dirs); exported from index.
- **Build fix:** turbo served **false-green cached** gate results for uncommitted changes
  (input hash didn't change on working-tree edits). Set `"cache": false` on
  build/typecheck/lint/test in `turbo.json`. Lesson captured:
  [[turbo-cache-stale-uncommitted]].

**Evidence/verification (fresh, cache bypassed):** typecheck · lint · format · build all
execute & pass; **test: core 15 + storage 9 = 24** (storage now correctly runs both queue +
blob suites). verify-state valid.

**Remaining for F-003:** inc 4 = SQLite `RelationalStore` (Drizzle + **better-sqlite3**,
fallback node:sqlite) + relational conformance. Effect E-007 added when F-003 closes.

**Next step:** F-003 inc 4 (SQLite RelationalStore).

---

## 2026-06-28 — F-003 (in progress): storage ports + in-process queue [inc 1-2]
**What changed**
- New `@tessera/storage` package. Ports: `RelationalStore` / `BlobStore` / `Queue`
  (`src/ports/`). In-process `Queue` adapter (microtask delivery, retry up to maxAttempts,
  drain-on-shutdown) using `@tessera/core` errors.
- **Queue conformance suite** in `tests/conformance/` (ADR-0014) + `tests/integration` run
  against the in-process adapter (4 contract tests).

**Evidence/verification (green, executed):** typecheck · lint · format · test (core 15 +
storage 4 = 19) · build. verify-state valid (31 features, 6 effect-links).

**Remaining for F-003:** inc 3 = filesystem `BlobStore` + blob conformance; inc 4 = SQLite
`RelationalStore` (Drizzle + a driver — leaning **better-sqlite3**, ADR at that point) +
relational conformance + drizzle-kit migrations. Effect **E-007** (storage port ⇒ adapters +
conformance) added when F-003 closes.

**Next step:** F-003 inc 3 (filesystem `BlobStore`).

---

## 2026-06-28 — Decision: test organization = hybrid (ADR-0014)
**What changed** (convention, after research + lead's question)
- [ADR-0014](../../docs/adr/0014-test-organization-hybrid.md): **unit tests co-located** in
  `src/` (white-box, short imports, refactor-safe); **integration + e2e + port conformance
  suites** in a separate per-package `tests/` dir (app e2e in `apps/*/tests/e2e`, `apps/web/e2e`).
- Codified in [`rules/common/testing.md`](../rules/common/testing.md) (new Layout section);
  ADR index updated.
- `@tessera/core`'s current tests are all unit → stay co-located (no move).

**Decision** (AskUserQuestion): hybrid chosen over full-separation (brittle `../../src`
imports + mirrored tree) and over co-locate-everything (integration/e2e don't map to one file).

**Evidence/verification:** link-check + verify-state (this session).
**Next step:** **F-003** — storage ports + SQLite/filesystem adapters + conformance suite
(first feature to use `tests/integration` + `tests/conformance`).

---

## 2026-06-28 — F-002 DONE: @tessera/core domain primitives
**What changed**
- Fleshed out `@tessera/core` (was a shell): `id.ts` (branded `Id<Brand>`, `newId` via
  `node:crypto`, `isId`), `errors.ts` (`TesseraError` + Validation/NotFound/Conflict/
  Unauthorized/Forbidden/Internal + `ErrorCode`), `result.ts` (`Result`/`ok`/`err`/`isOk`/
  `isErr`), `config.ts` (`DeploymentProfile`, `DEPLOYMENT_PROFILES`, `CoreConfig`, guard),
  `events.ts` (typed in-process `createEventBus`). `index.ts` re-exports all.
- Config: core `tsconfig` `types:["node"]` (for node:crypto); eslint `no-undef:off` (TS handles it).
- Effect **E-006**: @tessera/core public API → every package/app (change additively).

**Evidence/verification** (executed, green)
- typecheck ✓ · lint ✓ · format:check ✓ · test ✓ (**6 files, 15 tests**) · build ✓ (emits dist).
- `verify-state` valid.

**Decisions**
- Node-targeted core (uses `node:crypto`); browser consumers use the SDK/API, not core directly.
- `Result` type provided for explicit domain failures alongside thrown `TesseraError`.

**Next step:** **F-003** — storage ports + SQLite/filesystem adapters + conformance suite.

---

## 2026-06-28 — Phase B.3: general-purpose execution skills (ECC-adapted) [F-031 done]
**What changed** (general-purpose harness layer; the gap the lead flagged)
- New skills (tool-agnostic, MIT-adapted from ECC — see [`NOTICE.md`](../../NOTICE.md)):
  [`strategic-compact`](../skills/strategic-compact/SKILL.md) (compact at phase boundaries),
  [`continuous-learning`](../skills/continuous-learning/SKILL.md) (lessons →
  [`memory/lessons/`](../memory/lessons/)), [`coding-standards`](../skills/coding-standards/SKILL.md)
  (indexes the rules).
- Enriched [`rules/common/engineering.md`](../rules/common/engineering.md) (KISS/DRY/YAGNI,
  small functions, no magic numbers, parallel async) + [`testing.md`](../rules/common/testing.md) (AAA).
- **Wired into protocols** (not fragile hooks): strategic-compact in workflow + session-lifecycle;
  continuous-learning in clean-state + definition-of-done. `.claude/skills` shims added.
- ADR-0013 (adopt ECC-derived skills; hooks deferred; broader agents/commands added as we code).
  ADR-0012 marked retired (agy). Memory: `ecc-harness-reference`.

**Decisions** (delegated to Claude): adopt the 3 named skills only (not broader ECC
agents/commands yet); **wire into protocols, defer executable hooks** (Windows-fragile,
upkeep) — record as optional future enhancement.

**Evidence/verification:** link-check + verify-state (this session's verify run).

**Next step:** **F-002** — `@tessera/core` (ids, typed errors, config types, event bus).

---

## 2026-06-28 — F-001 DONE: monorepo & toolchain scaffold
**What changed** (first coding feature; activates the verification gates)
- Turborepo + pnpm workspace: `package.json` (scripts→gates), `pnpm-workspace.yaml`,
  `turbo.json` (tasks), `tsconfig.base.json` (strict: noUncheckedIndexedAccess,
  exactOptionalPropertyTypes, noImplicitOverride, verbatimModuleSyntax, NodeNext).
- ESLint 9 flat config (`eslint.config.mjs`) incl. **package-boundary rule** (ADR-0001);
  Prettier (scoped to code + root config; docs/harness excluded by design); Vitest.
- First package `@tessera/core` (shell: `VERSION`/`coreVersion()` + 2 tests) to prove the
  toolchain end-to-end. F-002 fleshes it out.
- CI: `.github/workflows/ci.yml` mirroring gates.json (ADR-0010) + `pnpm audit`; `.env.example`.
- Flipped `verification/gates.json` typecheck/lint/format/test/build → **active** (e2e stays
  pending). Added effect **E-005** (CI ⇄ gates.json must stay in lockstep).

**Evidence/verification** (all green, executed)
- `pnpm install` ok (turbo 2.10, eslint 9.39, ts 5.9, vitest 2.1, prettier 3.9).
- typecheck ✓ · lint ✓ · format:check ✓ ("All matched files use Prettier code style!") ·
  test ✓ (2 passed) · build ✓ (emits `packages/core/dist`).
- **Boundary rule proven:** a deliberate `@tessera/other/src/x` import made `lint` FAIL
  (exit 1, no-restricted-imports); removing it returned lint to green.
- `node scripts/verify-state.mjs` valid (30 features, 5 effect-links).

**Decisions**
- Prettier scoped to code + root config only (markdown/docs/.harness hand-maintained) — a
  pragmatic scoping, revisit if we want prettier on docs. Type-aware ESLint deferred until
  real domain packages exist (F-002+); scaffold uses recommended + boundary rule.

**Next step:** **F-002** — `@tessera/core` (ids, typed errors, config types, event bus).

---

## 2026-06-28 — agy/Gemini worker integration removed (decision: not using agy)
**Decision:** we will **not** use `agy`/Gemini as a sub-agent in this project. The build-phase
worker integration added earlier (commit `e6713c2`) is fully removed: deleted ADR-0012, the
`delegate-to-worker` skill, the `/delegate` command + skill shim, and `scripts/agy-worker.ps1`
/`.sh`; removed feature F-031; stripped the agy section from `governance/tool-access.md` and the
references in the ADR index, skills index, `policy-model.md`, and coverage matrix. History is
preserved (this is a forward removal commit, not a rewrite). The decision is recorded in
[`REQUIREMENTS-COVERAGE.md`](../../docs/REQUIREMENTS-COVERAGE.md) so it isn't re-proposed.

**Evidence/verification:** verify-state valid; internal link-check 0 broken (this session).

**Next step:** coding — claim **F-001** (scaffold).

---

## 2026-06-27 — Phase B.1 addendum: governance policy model + ecosystem positioning
**What changed** (after reviewing Databricks **Omnigent**, a meta-harness)
- Added [`.harness/governance/policy-model.md`](../governance/policy-model.md): static +
  **stateful/contextual** policies (scopes, post-action triggers, resource-scoped writes,
  cost budgets, **egress-proxy credential injection**), with an honest enforcement matrix.
  Wired into governance README + tool-access.
- Product positioning: PRD **NG7** (Tessera is *not* an orchestrator) + new **§5.1 Ecosystem
  & interoperability**; ARCHITECTURE §2 "Ecosystem position". Tessera = MCP context/memory
  layer **complementary** to meta-harnesses (Omnigent); it fills Omnigent's context gap.

**Decision** (AskUserQuestion): adopt the stateful governance model + interoperability
positioning; do **not** build orchestrator/sandbox/live-session infra (out of scope).

**Next step:** coding — claim **F-001** (scaffold).

---

## 2026-06-27 — Phase B.1: pre-code hardening (gaps from brief review)
**What changed**
- Added the **design system**: [`docs/design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`](../../docs/design/DESIGN-SYSTEM.md)
  (tokens via tweakcn/shadcn, layout via efferd, components via coss/shadcn, motion, full UX
  baseline, a11y, perf) + **ADR-0009** (frontend stack locked; responsive web, **not PWA**).
- Captured two dropped brief items: **ADR-0011** billing via Dodo Payments (R2 direction) and
  **ADR-0010** CI/CD via GitHub Actions. Updated the ADR index.
- Added [`docs/REQUIREMENTS-COVERAGE.md`](../../docs/REQUIREMENTS-COVERAGE.md) tracing the
  entire original brief → PRD/ADR/harness, or gap.
- PRD: +FR-61 (billing), +NFR-15 (CI/CD), +NG6 (no PWA), design-system references.
- Code harness made explicit: [`F-001 scaffold plan`](../plans/F-001-monorepo-toolchain-scaffold.md)
  (tsconfig strict flags, eslint boundary rule, prettier, vitest, turbo, CI, scripts→gates);
  frontend rule now binds to the design system.
- State: +F-028 (UI foundation, R0), +F-029 (CI/CD), +F-030 (billing, R2); F-014 now
  blockedBy F-028; +effect E-004 (design tokens → all components).

**Evidence/verification**
- `node scripts/verify-state.mjs` valid (30 features, 4 effect-links); link-check 0 broken
  (see verification run for this session).

**Decisions** (via AskUserQuestion): capture billing now/build R2 (Dodo); responsive web not
PWA; lock frontend stack ADR now.

**Next step**
- Coding phase: claim **F-001** (scaffold) — plan already written.

---

## 2026-06-27 — Phase B: agent harness built
**What changed**
- Built the tool-agnostic global harness under [`.harness/`](../) plus root
  [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) (mandatory) and [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md).
- Authored: instructions (workflow, session-lifecycle), modular rules
  (common/typescript/api/frontend/security), skills (add-feature, write-adr, effect-trace,
  verify-gate), commands (next-feature, verify, checkpoint), protocols (initialization,
  verification, definition-of-done, clean-state, effect-link, observability), governance
  (commit, secrets, tool-access, adr), plans (README + TEMPLATE), verification
  (gates.json + checklist).
- Seeded state: this log, [`feature_list.json`](feature_list.json) (R0 features F-001…F-016
  detailed + R1–R3 backlog F-017…F-027), [`effects.json`](effects.json) (invariants
  E-001…E-003), and JSON schemas.
- Added the Claude Code adapter ([`.claude/`](../../.claude/)) with settings, command shims,
  and planner/generator/evaluator subagents.
- Added `scripts/init.ps1` + `init.sh` + `scripts/verify-state.mjs`.
- Added service-scoped harness stubs under `apps/api` and `apps/web` (extend root).

**Evidence/verification**
- `node scripts/verify-state.mjs` — state files valid (see Phase B verification entry).
- Internal markdown link-check across the harness — 0 broken.

**Decisions**
- Harness is agnostic-core (`.harness/`) + thin Claude adapter (`.claude/`), mirroring the
  product's agent-agnostic stance. Recorded in memory [[harness-model]].

**Next step**
- Begin the coding phase: claim **F-001** (monorepo & toolchain scaffold) via
  [`/next-feature`](../commands/next-feature.md); that activates the pending-toolchain gates.

## 2026-06-27 — Phase A: product definition shipped
**What changed**
- Brand finalized **Tessera** / `@tessera/*` (ADR-0008; supersedes ContextOS).
- Wrote [`docs/PRD.md`](../../docs/PRD.md) (FR-*/NFR-* ids), 
  [`docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md`](../../docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md),
  ADRs 0001–0008 (Accepted), glossary, roadmap; repo hygiene; `git init`.

**Evidence/verification**
- Internal link-check: 78 links, 0 broken. Branding scan: only intentional codename refs.
- Committed as `aaaf84f` (genesis commit on `main`, no remote).

**Decisions**
- Locked Drizzle (ADR-0005), Transformers.js/Ollama + sqlite-vec→pgvector (ADR-0006).

**Next step**
- Phase B (harness) — done in the entry above.
